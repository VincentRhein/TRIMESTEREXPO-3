          Welcome to the Trimester exposition#3 of the School for Young Talent!
          <br><br>
          The School for Young Talent is the secondary school of the Royal Academy of Art (KABK), the Dance Department and the Royal Conservatoire (KC).
          See <a href="https://www.koncon.nl/opleidingen?courseDegree=school-for-young-talent" target="_self">www.svjt.nl</a>   for everything about the school and the disciplines Visual Arts, Music and Dance.
          <br><br>
          Our Visual Arts students work at the KABK four half days a week. The year is divided into three trimesters, which we conclude with a Trimester exposition. Usually it takes place in the gallery at the KABK, but due to the current situation it has become a digital version.
          How nice that you are at this scoop!
          <br><br>
          Last trimester our classes 1, 2 and 3 worked within the theme “design: craft-based, industrial and graphic”. You can see their vision and works in this digital exhibition between the works of our  upper class (classes 4, 5 and 6). They each chose one work that they have worked on in the past month.
          <br><br>
          Click on the work and come to a page with more images, explanations and a chat opportunity. All visitors to this digital exhibition can chat live with all students on July 8 between 17:00 and 19:00! Ask your question, give a compliment. Just as you are used to doing during a physical exhibition.
          You only have to fantasize about the tasty snacks, drinks and the buzz this time…
          <br><br>
          Have fun at this Trimester exposition and hopefully next time live in our building!
